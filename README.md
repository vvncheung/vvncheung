Hi there 👋 ! I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for elegant, user-friendly, and intuitive design.

- ✨ I build with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Express, Node.js, React.js, Ruby on Rails.
- 🌱  I'm currently learning Python, Kotlin, and more.
- ☁️ In my spare time, I like to cook, run, and tend to my indoor jungle.

Fun things I've made:
- [Campfire](https://github.com/htkim94/campfire): web app that allows friends to find, queue, and play YouTube videos while chatting together.
- [lotide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vvncheung/lotide): my own mini clone of the Lodash testing library, published on npm.

Curious and want to see more?
